# create_app is a function which will automatically called by the
# flask command line program create an instance of the application.

# The app is always the same. However, we might want it run on a
# different database for testing. This ability to call a function to
# create an app allows to manage this easily.

    # The config contains parameters (like db connection, perhaps some
    # secret keys and things like that. We're loading the config
    # directly from a mapping (dict like object). However, there are
    # other ways to load config (and usually, we load them from
    # files. You can refer to
    # https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/config/ to understand
    # different ways of loading files.
    #
    # There is no one single way to do this. There are multiple ways
    # to do it since there are multiple setups possible.

    # Flask apps can either be written with all the URLs, code, db
    # etc. everything in a single file. This will make it very hard to
    # manage. Creating blueprints allows us to create "mini
    # applications" which can be all pulled together by the main
    # application to create the whole app. Blueprints can also share
    # code so that duplication is limited.  Refer to
    # https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/blueprints/

    # We create the application as a python package. This page
    # describes how it works.
    # https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages. We
    # import the jobs module in this package and then register the
    # blueprint we've created in there into the main application
    # thereby adding all the URLs defined inside jobs to the main app.

    # hook to close database connections when we're
    # done.
