This directory will contain .sql files which are run at various times
in the project (e.g. creation of datatabases and such).

I'm using the 000, 010, etc. prefix to indicate the order in which
these files were added. To create the entire database, we will have to
run files from 000 to the latest in numerical order. The later files
might have "alter table" statements that will change tables defined by
the earlier files.
